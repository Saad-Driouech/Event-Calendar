# Django Personal Event Calender

## How To Setup
After cloning, creating, and activating virtual environment, install Requirements Package `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Start by adding students using the "New Student" button. Then create groups using "New group" button.

Create courses using the "New Course" button. Then create professors using the "New Professor" button.

Create availabilities of the professor using "New Availability" button.

Create preferences of the professor using "New Preference" button (if needed).

Create a session using the "New session" buuton. Once you click submit the console will display messages reflecting on what the system is doing and the results.



## Additional notes:
It is always a good idea to keep referring to the admin django website to display details about groups, availabilities, and preferences while the system is running. I did not bother to create templates for displaying details since it is not a priority right now. My next priority is to include checking for the availability of the venues.
Another reason why I did not focus on the front end is because this solution will be integrated with your already existing solution once the back end is fully working.
